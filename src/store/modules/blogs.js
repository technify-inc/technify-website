      content:
        "Dogecoin shot up more than 20% Tuesday, following a tweet from Musk that Tesla will begin accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for merchandise. Doge jumped from just under 16 cents to more than 21 cents at its peak. It has since seen some profit taking and, as of 9:15 a.m. ET, was trading at just under 20 cents, a 21% spike. The surge of interest in Dogecoin comes as other cryptos are down across the board. Bitcoin continues to trade below its 200-day moving average and Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and all other major coins are showing 24-hour losses.Tesla will make some merch buyable with Doge & see how it goes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 14, 2021 Musk, the freshly minted Time Person of the Year for 2021, has been a notable influencer when it comes to Dogecoin. In April, he posted a series of Doge images and memes on Twitter that spurred his followers into buying the crypto, resulting in gains of 600% in one week. In May, though, while hosting Saturday Night Live, he downplayed Doge, sending it into a tailspin from which it has never recovered. Before his SNL gig, it spiked as high as 74 cents, and Doge-watchers were convinced it would top $1. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that no one was meant to take seriously. Ten thousand new Dogecoins are programmed to be issued every minute for the rest of eternity, meaning the value was never meant to hold. But mentions from everyone from Musk to Mark Cuban to Guy Fieri have kept it in the spotlight, and traders have decided to defy logic.",

        "Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison is almost $16 billion richer as of Friday's close, passing Google's co-founders and inching him towards Microsoft's Bill Gates. Oracle's stock surged 16% following a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report late Thursday. Ellison, the company's biggest stakeholder with 1.14 billion shares, is now worth $135.7 billion, according to Forbes. The Oracle rally, its second-biggest in the past 20 years, was a huge boon to Ellison, who co-founded the software company in 1977. On the Forbes billionaires list, he's moved just ahead of Google's Larry Page ($126.3 billion) and Sergey Brin ($121.7 billion) into fifth place. Gates, the world's fourth-wealthiest person, is worth $139.2 billion. ADVERTISING Ellison's resurgence comes as somewhat of a surprise considering the next-generation tech companies, like Google, Amazon and Facebook, have been growing so much faster in recent years while Oracle has plodded along with mostly single-digit growth. But Oracle is showing signs of acceleration and the company's latest guidance topped estimates, giving investors heightened confidence that its shift to the cloud is working. Having his personal wealth rise back above Google's founders is likely to be a particularly sweet achievement for Ellison. In April, the Supreme Court sided with Google against Oracle in a long-running copyright dispute over the software used in the Android mobile operating system. The case concerned software code that Google used to build Android and was seen as a landmark dispute over what types of computer code are protected under American copyright law.",
